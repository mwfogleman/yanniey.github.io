description: I study a lot of things. Finance for work, languages for fun, web development for staying mobile and employable, and many others. Borrowing Gandhi's word. "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." Because I need to see tangible progresses to keep motivated about my studies, I create <a href="http://guoanyi.com/" class="hvr-float">this website</a> to host my daily check-ins in the hope that one day I can look back at my early-twenties and see that my time was well spent on worthy causes.
