description: In the summer of 2014, I met two very awesome programmers during my internship at <a href="http://culture.fool.com/2014/09/29/summer-office-video-college-internships/" class="hvr-float">The Motley Fool</a>. I was very inspired by the kind of lives that they lead, so I decided to take a look at the things that they do. I started learning programming through <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/anyiguo" class="hvr-float">Treehouse</a>, moved on to the famous <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/" class="hvr-float">CS50</a>, and now I'm currently taking offline classes at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/labs/offline" class="hvr-float">Codecademy Labs</a>. As is the custom for programmers, here is <a href="https://github.com/yanniey" class="hvr-float">my Github</a>. Warning first: I claim whole merit for codes that work, and I have zero responsibility for codes that don't work. :shipit:
