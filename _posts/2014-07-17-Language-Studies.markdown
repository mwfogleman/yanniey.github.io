description: I'm still working on building a site that hosts my language study progresses and study notes. The goal is to be fluent (C1 level) in French and Spanish class by the end of 2015. I currently have weekly French classes on <a href="http://www.italki.com/">Italki</a>, and I do daily exercises on <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/yanniey" class="hvr-float">Duolingo</a> and <a href="http://www.memrise.com/user/yanniey/" class="hvr-float">Memrise</a>. I write in French on <a href="http://lang-8.com/337559" class="hvr-float">Lang-8</a> where I make a ton of awkward grammatical mistakes that I'm not aware of.
