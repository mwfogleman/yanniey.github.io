description: Douban is the a Chinese website that is equivalent to Goodreads plus RottenTomatoes plus Reddit. I've been using it to host my reading list since 2005. Check out a visualization of things that I read <a href="http://www.doubanj.com/people/yanniey/" class="hvr-float">here</a>. It is in Chinese, but you can get a pretty good idea of how varied books that I read are.
